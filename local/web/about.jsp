            Our Story: How We Started 
        </p>
 
        <p>
            Team1 Tires first opened its doors in 1960, when Bruce T. Halle 
            rented an old plumbing supply building on Stadium Boulevard in Ann
            Arbor, Michigan. Bruce cleaned out the building, built countertops,
            repainted the sign outside, and displayed his initial six-tire 
            inventory. As the store’s only employee upon its opening, Bruce 
            served as the tire technician, cleaning crew, salesman, and 
            accountant. Because he didn’t have an air compressor, Bruce would
            even haul a portable air tank to and from a nearby gas station so 
            that he could inflate the tires he sold. Over time, Bruce nurtured
            that first Team1 Tire store through hard work and a governing 
            philosophy that now serves as Team1 Tire’s founding principles: 
            treat people with respect and fairness, care for those in need, 
            always do what is right, work hard, be responsible, and have fun.
            By the end of the decade, our company grew to six stores and 
            established a strong reputation for customer satisfaction.
